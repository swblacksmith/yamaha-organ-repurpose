# Pedal board

The organ pedal board has 13 keys from C0 to C1. The pedal board will be repurposed to a MIDI-controller using a [Teensy 3.2](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy32.html) chip as the central microcontroller.

The user interface design and keyscan schematic design is heavily inspired by the [WOMinator MIDI bass pedals by Lee O'Donnell](http://www.bassmaker.co.uk/wominator.html) - in our opinion, his user interface has a nice recognition of what a musician needs to be readily available while playing live while still keeping it simple, and his keyscan schematic is optimized componentwise by taking advantage of the mechanical properties of the pedal key SPDT contacts.
